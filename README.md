* Converts answer to text ([Cloud Text-to-Speech API, aka Cloud Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/))

## Requirements

### Node.js v10
Node.js v8 required, but Node.js v10 recommended because Http2 module of Node.js (AVS uses HTTP2)

## CreateCapabilities tool
This tool creates cabilities for connector, and registers 
1. Copy AVS credential (config.json) to ./cfg dir (or you can use custom path with custom filename)
1. Copy and rename Google Cloud credential to ./cfg dir as googleConfig.json. (Suppose Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech API are sharing the same project) (or you can use custom path with custom filename)
1. Start tools/CreateCapabilities.js. There are optional parameters for config files, and for language. You can see them with --help 
1. Follow the steps of tools/CreateCapabilities.js.
1. After it is finished, displays the required Capabilities.

## TODO
1. If a text is very long (more thousand), then connector dies because AVS error. Long messages should be sent in chunks.
1. Stream/connection create/close optimalization. Create/close global, for dialog, or for question-answer pair?
1. Auth token lifetime is 1h. Deal with it. (Acquire it frequently, or catch error, and refresh token)
