This is a [Botium](https://github.com/codeforequity-at/botium-core) connector for testing your Amazon Alexa Skills.

__Did you read the [Botium in a Nutshell](https://medium.com/@floriantreml/botium-in-a-nutshell-part-1-overview-f8d0ceaf8fb4) articles ? Be warned, without prior knowledge of Botium you won't be able to properly use this library!__

## How it worksÂ ?
The steps for Botium to run a conversation with an Alexa skill are:

* Converts text to speech ([Cloud Speech-to-Text API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/))
* Asks Alexa with [Amazon AVS](https://developer.amazon.com/de/docs/alexa-voice-service/get-started-with-alexa-voice-service.html)
* Converts answer to text ([Cloud Text-to-Speech API, aka Cloud Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/))

It can be used as any other Botium connector with all Botium Stack components:
* [Botium CLI](https://github.com/codeforequity-at/botium-cli/)
* [Botium Bindings](https://github.com/codeforequity-at/botium-bindings/)
* [Botium Box](https://www.botium.at)

The Alexa skill to test doesn't have to be published - it can be tested while still in "development mode", making this connector the perfect choice for __Continuous Testing in CI Pipelines__.

## Requirements

### Node.js v10
Node.js v8 required, but Node.js v10 recommended because Http2 module of Node.js (AVS uses HTTP2) 

### Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API
1.  [Select or create](https://console.cloud.google.com/project) a Cloud Platform project
2.  [Enable billing](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6293499#enable-billing) for your project (free tier available).
3.  [Enable](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=texttospeech.googleapis.com) the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.
4.  [Set up authentication with a service account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) so you can access the
    API from your local workstation. You will need the JSON credentials file later.

### Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
* Same steps as in Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API, just other API
* It is recommended that Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech API are sharing the same project and the same credentials

### Amazon AVS API of the Product to test
[Steps to setup](https://developer.amazon.com/de/docs/alexa-voice-service/code-based-linking-other-platforms.html#step1) - follow "Step 1: Enable CBL" and note your "Client ID", the "Client secret" and your "Product ID".

## Preparing Botium Capabilities

The connector repository includes a tool to compose the Botium capabilities (including private keys, access tokens etc). Create a project directory of your choice, and follow the steps below.

### 1. Prepare amazonConfig.json

Copy AVS Product ID, Client ID and Client secret from steps above to a file named amazonConfig.json (see sample in cfg folder of this repository):

```
{
 "deviceInfo": {
  "clientId": "xxx",
  "clientSecret": "xxx",
  "productId": "xxx"
 }
}
```

### 2. Prepare googleConfig.json

Copy and rename Google Cloud JSON credentials to a file named googleConfig.json. (Suppose Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech API are sharing the same project)

```
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "xxx",
  ...
}

```

### 3. Run the "Botium Connector Alexa AVS Initialization Tool"

There are several ways of running this tool, depending on how you installed it:

When you are using the Botium CLI, then just run
```
> botium-cli init-alexa-avs
```

When you installed the NPM package for this repository, then run
```
> botium-connector-alexa-avs-init
```

When you cloned or downloaded this repository, and you are in the "samples" folder, then run
```
> npm run init-alexa-avs
or
> ./node_modules/.bin/botium-connector-alexa-avs-init
```

Either way, there are optional parameters for config files, and for language. You can see them with --help.
Just follow the suggested steps, you will be presented a hyperlink you have to open in your browser to connect the Botium virtual device to your Amazon account.

### 4. Use the generated botium.json
A file named botium.json is generated containing the required capabilities to be used with Botium.
The sample botiumFluent.js in the "samples" folder asks Alexa for washing powder (in german language).

_You may remove the amazonConfig.json and googleConfig.json now_

## Supported Capabilities

## Open Issues and Restrictions
* If a text is very long (more thousand), then connector dies because AVS error. Long messages should be sent in chunks.
* Stream/connection create/close optimalization. Create/close global, for dialog, or for question-answer pair?
* Auth token lifetime is 1h. Deal with it. (Acquire it frequently, or catch error, and refresh token)
